1. What advantages does Knowledge Graph offer for data selection?	
- Knowledge Graph enables semantic data retrieval, allowing irrelevant samples to be filtered out.
- It ensures data consistency and introduces hierarchical relationships (e.g., Car → Sedan, Truck).
2. How significant is the impact of high-quality annotated data on model performance?	
- High-quality annotations can significantly improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
- You can compare the performance gap between random sampling and KG-based selection.
3. How can Knowledge Graph enhance machine learning workflows?
- Provides semantic support during the data preparation stage.
- Assists model interpretability in the explanation phase.
- Enables knowledge-augmented reasoning when integrated with LLMs.
4. What were the main challenges encountered?	
- Insufficient data and complex KG structures.
- Low quality data prevent high quality training
- Difficulty in environment configuration issues (e.g., Docker, Colab, python requirements).
